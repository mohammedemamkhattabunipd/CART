# CART single-cell data Integration
#### This is the project of my masters thesis in Prof. Gabriele Sales Lab, at the Department of Biology University of Padua, titled "CAR T-cell Atlas for Identifying Patient response variability using single cell integration", using single cell transciptomics data from three different studies;

#### 1. [Post-infusion CAR TReg cells identify patients resistant to CD19-CAR therapy](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01960-7) by Good et. al
#### 2. [Distinct cellular dynamics associated with response to CAR-T therapy for refractory B cell lymphoma](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01959-0) by Haradhvala et. al
#### 3. [CAR+ and CARâˆ’ T cells share a differentiation trajectory into an NK-like subset after CD19 CAR T cell infusion in patients with B cell malignancies](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43656-7) by Louie et. al
